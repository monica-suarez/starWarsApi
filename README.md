# starWarsApi
choose an App you want to build
pair-up with someone based on your interests
create a repo
clone it to one of your machines
npm init
Understand dotenv
npm install dotenv --save
require('dotenv').config() at the top of your main.js
save your api key in the .env file like this:
SECRET_KEY=abcd1234
git add commit push
now clone it to your other machine
repeat the .env file process so each of you have a copy of the api key
work in separate branches (be careful of merge conflicts)
focus on functionality first
only style after you have all the functionality working
The projects can become a final project if you like. You can continue building them on your own or together. In class, however, we are just going to focus on accessing the API and do a few simple things with the data we get back.

star wars api project
swapi.dev
Build a game that can challenge two users to answer question about star wars.
If they get it right they get a point added to their side. (Use the logic from your ticTacToe game to get an idea of how to switch users)
